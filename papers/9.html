			<h1>Journal of Software: Evolution and Process (Special Issue on Microservice and AIOps)</h1>
			<article>
				<p>本专刊与2021年CCF中国软件大会（CCF Chinasoft 2021）合作。投稿本专刊并通过第一轮评审的国内论文作者需要注册参加本次大会并在“微服务与智能化运维”论坛上进行论文报告交流。</p>

				<p>Microservice architecture has been the mainstream of cloud native software applications. Nowadays,
					more and more companies have chosen to migrate from the so-called monolithic architecture to
					microservice architecture. Industrial microservice systems can be extremely complex. Typically, a
					large-scale microservice system can include hundreds to thousands of services and is complicated due
					to the extremely small grained services and their complex interactions and the complex
					configurations of the runtime environments. Moreover, a microservice system can be highly dynamic:
					service instances can be dynamically created and destroyed and the invocations of the same service
					can be accomplished by different instances. The complexity and dynamism of microservice systems pose
					great and unique challenges to microservice design, development, testing, debugging, deployment,
					operation, maintenance, and evolution.</p>

				<p>The nature of microservice systems calls for stronger and more intelligent support of IT operations.
					Therefore, AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations), which applies artificial intelligence
					(AI) to enhance IT operations, has been a necessary capability of microservice teams. AIOps collects
					and uses a large amount of operations data (e.g., logs, traces, and metrics) to monitor the runtime
					operations of the system, identify significant events related to performance and availability
					issues, diagnose root cause, and even resolve the issues automatically. AIOps is still in its
					infancy and requires academia and industry to keep exploring the research and practices of AIOps.
				</p>

				<p>The Special issue on microservice and AIOps is an initiative to bring this emerging area and related
					topics to the attention of the communities of software and systems engineering. The focus of this
					special issue is to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners in academia and
					industry to present novel applications and areas of research as well as new empirical results and
					insights, and to present new techniques and tool support for advancing microservice and AIOps and
					its impact. In this special issue we both invite extended versions of selected papers from
					collaborating workshops, and solicit novel submissions related to microservice and AIOps.</p>


				<p>The list of topics includes but not limited to:</p>

				<p>1. Microservice decomposition and architecture design</p>

				<p>2. Microservice development and DevOps</p>

				<p>3. Microservice testing and debugging</p>

				<p>4. Microservice deployment and updating</p>

				<p>5. Microservice logging and tracing</p>

				<p>6. Incident prediction of microservice systems</p>

				<p>7. Root cause localization of microservice faults and failures</p>

				<p>8. Runtime monitoring and visualization of microservice systems</p>

				<p>9. Runtime adaptation and optimization of microservice systems</p>

				<p>10. Microservice maintenance and evolution</p>

				<p>11. Microservice infrastructure (e.g., container, service mesh)</p>

				<p>12. Serverless and FaaS (Function as a Service)</p>

				<p>Important Dates</p>

				<p>Submission deadline: July 15, 2021</p>

				<p>First notification: October 15, 2021</p>

				<p>Revision submission: December 15, 2021</p>

				<p>Notification of acceptance: February 15, 2022</p>

				<p>Submission Guidelines</p>

				<p>1. Authors should prepare their manuscript according to the Guide for Authors of the Software:
					Evolution and Process. The submission site is</p>

				<p>http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jsme</p>

				<p>2. Please select “Microservice and AIOps” in the submission system. All the papers will be
					peer-reviewed following the Software: Evolution and Process reviewing procedures. Submitted
					manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication
					elsewhere. If the submission is an extended work of a previously published conference /workshop
					paper, you must submit a cover letter/document detailing (1) the "Summary of Differences" between
					the Conference/workshop paper and extended version paper, (2) a clear list of "new and original"
					ideas/contributions in the extended version paper (identifying sections where they are
					proposed/presented), (3) confirmation of the percentage of new material (at least 30%), and (4) the
					previously published conference/workshop paper.</p>
